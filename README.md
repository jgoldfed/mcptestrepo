# MCP Test Repository

## What is MCP?

MCP (Machine Coding Protocol) is a standardized interface that allows AI assistants to interact with coding platforms and services. It enables AI systems to perform coding tasks programmatically by providing a consistent set of operations across different environments.

### Key Features of MCP:

1. **GitHub Integration**: MCP allows AI assistants to interact with GitHub repositories, including:
   - Creating and managing repositories
   - Adding, updating, and deleting files
   - Creating issues and pull requests
   - Forking repositories and creating branches
   - Searching code, repositories, and issues

2. **Standardized Interface**: MCP provides a consistent API for AI systems to perform coding tasks, making it easier to develop AI tools that can work across different platforms.

3. **Automation Capabilities**: With MCP, AI assistants can automate common development workflows, such as setting up new projects, managing code changes, and collaborating with developers.

4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: MCP bridges the gap between AI systems and human developers, enabling more effective collaboration on coding projects.

This repository serves as a demonstration of MCP functionality, showing how AI assistants can create and manage GitHub repositories programmatically.
